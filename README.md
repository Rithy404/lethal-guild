##  Story

A countryside boy, born weak and without talent, dreams of becoming a legendary dungeon explorer.  
After years of training with nothing to show for it, he joins the **Adventurers’ Guild — Lethal Guild** at the lowest possible rank: **F-Rank**.

Restricted to the safest dungeon floors and weakest monsters, he takes on quests to gain experience, reputation, and strength.  
Each completed quest raises his rank, unlocking deeper dungeon floors filled with deadlier monsters and harsher trials.

**Can a talentless adventurer conquer every floor and rise to S-Rank?**
